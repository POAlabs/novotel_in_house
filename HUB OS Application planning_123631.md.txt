\# \*\*HUB OS Application – Final Specification Document\*\*



\### \*\*Application Name\*\*

\*\*HUB OS\*\* – Novotel Westlands Nairobi Internal Operations System



\### \*\*Problem Statement\*\*

Current issue reporting at the hotel relies on WhatsApp groups, paper logs, and verbal communication. This leads to:

\- Delayed response times

\- Lost or forgotten issues

\- No accountability or proof of resolution

\- Difficulty tracking recurring problems

\- Department silos and poor visibility for management



\### \*\*Solution\*\*

A centralized, real-time, mobile-friendly web application that allows every staff member to report issues instantly with photos, tracks progress, notifies the right people, and provides full transparency and audit trail — all while maintaining strict department privacy.
